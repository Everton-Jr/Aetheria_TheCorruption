## What is Aetheria?
Aetheria it's a roblox game inspired by Skyrim: The Elder Scrolls. This game it's an action RPG which you can do everthing in the game with multiple ways.


## Background Story
Long ago, Aetheria was inhabited by a powerful and enigmatic race known as the **Aethereans**. These beings were gifted with extraordinary magical abilities, enabling them to commune with the elements and shape the world around them.

However, the harmony and prosperity of Aetheria were not destined to last. As the ages passed, a dark and malevolent force seeped into the realm, corrupting its very essence. This vile influence affected even the gods themselves, twisting their divine nature and turning them into maleficent beings known as the Corrupted Gods.

**The Corrupted Gods**, once protectors and guardians of Aetheria, now sought dominion and control over the land and its people. Their corrupted powers wreaked havoc on the delicate balance of nature, unleashing chaos and devastation. As the people of Aetheria struggled to survive under this oppressive reign, hope dwindled, and fear gripped their hearts.

Amidst this turmoil, a prophecy emerged, whispered among the wise and the desperate. It spoke of an ancient artifact known as the Aetherial Keystone, said to hold the power to restore balance and banish the corruption that plagued the gods and the land. The prophecy foretold the arrival of a chosen hero, known as the Aetherial Champion, who would rise to confront the Corrupted Gods and fulfill their destiny.


## The Corrupted Gods have names?
In the realm of Aetheria, the Corrupted Gods, once benevolent and revered, have been tainted by darkness and now rule with malevolence. Each god carries their own twisted name, resonating with their corrupted essence:

### **Malakar**, the Shadow Lord
Once the god of light and guidance, Malakar has succumbed to darkness, embodying shadows and deceit. His presence casts an ominous shroud over the realm, corrupting all that it touches.

### **Vexaris**, the Soul Devourer
Formerly the god of life and renewal, Vexaris now feasts on the souls of the innocent, draining them of vitality. His insatiable hunger for power fuels his twisted reign, leaving behind desolate lands and shattered spirits.

### **Morgrath**, the Forsaken King
Once a revered ruler of justice and honor, Morgrath now commands an army of undead, seeking to conquer Aetheria with an iron fist. His decrepit kingdom serves as a testament to his fall from grace.

### **Lyssandra**, the Mistress of Illusions
Lyssandra was once the goddess of dreams and inspiration, but now she revels in illusions and delusions. She manipulates the minds of mortals, distorting reality and driving them to madness.

### **Thulgrim**, the Lord of Decay
